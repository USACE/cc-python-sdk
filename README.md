cc_sdk is the Python Software Development Kit used to develop plugins for Cloud Compute.

## Installation

You can install cc_sdk in two ways: from source or through the pip package manager.

### Installing from source

To install cc_sdk from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/USACE/cc-python-sdk.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd cc-python-sdk
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the package dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Install the build dependencies

```shell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
```

6. Build cc_sdk from the `pyproject.toml`:

```shell
python3 -m build
```

7. Install the generated wheel (replace <version> with the version of the wheel file built):

```shell
pip install dist/cc_sdk-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
```

or 

```shell
pip install dist/*.whl
```

Now you have successfully installed cc_sdk from source.

## Install from pre-built distribution

Download the release from the 'Releases' page of this repository, then install with pip:

```shell
pip install <path/to/wheel/*.whl>
```

### Installing through pip

To install cc_sdk using pip, simply run the following command:

```shell

This will download the latest version of cc_sdk from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and install it into your Python environment.
